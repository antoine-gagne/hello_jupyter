# hello_jupyter
This simple project showcases uses of the Jupyter Notebook project : 
http://jupyter.org/

## Getting started
Because Jupyter has so many dependencies, I highly recommend using a virtual
environment to isolate the requirements from the rest of the Python
distribution. More info here: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/
Make sure to specify the `--python=PYTHON_EXE`, with PYTHON_EXE being a path
to your Python3 installation.

In your virtualenv, run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then
`jupyter notebook`
to start the Jupyter server and view the code.
